# js-turing-machine
Command line Turing machine simulator written in JavaScript. Created for completing excersises at uni to simulate single-tape deterministic Turing Machines. (and unfinished double-tape implementation)

# Running

To run just run `main.js` using Node.js

To create your own Turing machines, set your input, head position, states and rules. Example TM for counting number of symbols in binary can be found here `machines/binaryCountOfSymbols.js`
